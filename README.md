# Loan-Default-Risk-Analytics-Dashboard
An end-to-end BFSI analytics project built to identify high-risk loan applicants for Home Credit Group, using SQL, Python, and Power BI — covering portfolio health, risk segmentation, demographic patterns, and a custom rule-based risk-scoring model.

📌 Short Description / Purpose
This project analyzes 307,511 loan applications from Home Credit Group (a global consumer lending company) to uncover the key drivers of loan default. It combines SQL for data cleaning, Python for exploratory analysis and risk-score design, and Power BI for an interactive 4-page dashboard. The goal is to help credit risk teams flag high-risk applicants early — using a simple, explainable model rather than a black-box machine learning approach.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The project was built using the following tools and technologies:

🗄️ MySQL Workbench – Data cleaning, column selection, and derived-column logic (age, employment years, income-to-credit ratio)
🐍 Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) – Exploratory Data Analysis, correlation analysis, and rule-based Risk Score design
📊 Power BI Desktop – Main dashboard and visualization platform
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures, conditional formatting gradients, cumulative % (Pareto logic), and bookmark-driven view toggling
📝 Data Modeling – Single-table model (Final_Loan_Data) with calculated columns for age group, credit group, ratio group, and risk category
📁 File Format – .sql for queries, .ipynb for analysis, .png for dashboard previews
📂 Data Source
Source: Home Credit Default Risk – Kaggle

The dataset (application_train.csv) contains 307,511 loan applications from Home Credit Group, a multinational lending company that serves customers with limited or no traditional credit history ("thin-file" borrowers). Of the original 122 columns, 21 relevant fields were selected — covering applicant demographics, income, loan details, region rating, and three external credit bureau scores (EXT_SOURCE_1/2/3).

✨ Features / Highlights
🎯 Business Problem
Home Credit Group faces two competing risks on every loan decision:

Approving risky applicants → loan defaults → direct financial loss
Rejecting reliable applicants → lost interest income → customers go to competitors
The company had applicant-level data (income, education, job type, region, credit bureau scores) but no clear, explainable way to answer:

Which applicant segments are most likely to default?
Is the company's own region-risk rating actually accurate?
Can a simple, non-ML rule flag high-risk applicants early?
🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver a 4-page interactive Power BI report that:

Breaks down default risk across loan type, income, education, family status, occupation, age, region, and gender
Validates whether existing company assumptions (e.g., region ratings) hold up against the data
Introduces a transparent, rule-based Risk Score that flags high-risk applicants without requiring ML infrastructure
🖥️ Walkthrough of Key Visuals
Page 1 — Portfolio Health

KPI cards: Total Applicants (307,511), Default Rate (8.07%), Total Loan Amount, High Risk Count (1,504)
Pareto chart: Default rate by occupation, with cumulative % — applicants with an "Unknown" occupation show the highest default rate (33.5%)
Donut chart: Cash loans (90.5%) vs. Revolving loans (9.5%), with Cash loans showing a higher default rate (8.3% vs 5.5%)
Page 2 — Risk Segmentation

Bar chart: Default rate by education level — ranges from 1.9% (Academic Degree) to 10.6% (Lower Secondary)
Bookmark-toggled view: a summary bar chart of Family Status default rates, switchable to a full Family Status × Education Level matrix with conditional-formatting heatmap
Donut chart: Income type distribution — 51.6% of applicants are salaried ("Working")
Page 3 — Demographics & Regional Analysis

Line chart: Default rate declines steadily with age, from 11.4% (20–30) to 4.9% (60–70)
Bar charts: Default rate by Region Rating (4.8% → 11.1%) and by Gender (Male 10.1% vs Female 7.0%)
Age Group × Region Rating matrix: reveals that applicants aged 20–30 in Region Rating 3 default at 15.94% — nearly double the portfolio average, and higher than either factor alone
Page 4 — Financial Behavior & Risk Scoring

Bar charts: Default rate by Credit Amount group and Income-to-Credit Ratio group — both show a non-linear, U-shaped pattern where mid-range values carry more risk than the extremes
Ribbon chart: Applicant distribution across credit-score bands, segmented by default status
Gauge chart: the flagship visual — showing the Risk Score's flagged "High Risk" segment (23.8% default rate) against the portfolio average (8.07%), a 3x risk multiplier
💡 Business Impact & Insights
Risk Score validation: The custom rule (low credit score + young age + high-risk region) flags just 0.5% of applicants, but that group defaults at 3x the portfolio average — proving a simple, explainable rule can meaningfully sharpen underwriting decisions without machine learning.
Compounded risk: Individual risk factors understate real risk when combined — age and region together nearly double the expected default rate.
Rating system validation: Home Credit's existing region-rating system is statistically accurate and should be retained, not replaced.
Non-linear financial risk: Larger loans and higher income-to-credit ratios are not automatically safer — mid-range segments need the most scrutiny, challenging a common assumption in credit risk.
